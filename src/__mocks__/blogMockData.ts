## Overview

The *call stack*, or commonly called just **stack**, \`oooo\` operates on a LIFO basis. It is handy to visualise this with the famous Tower of Hanoi game:

![[Tower of Hanoi Memory - Stack example.png]]

\`\`\`
const test = () => {}
\`\`\`

So from the example above, if you want to remove item '2' you would have to remove item '1' prior to the removal, therefore, you will always have older items nearer the base of the stack. 

\`\`\`
const test = () => {}
const test = () => {}
\`\`\`
